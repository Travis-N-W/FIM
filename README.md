# File Integrity Monitoring

## Basic File Integrity Monitor (FIM) in PowerShell

### Brief Objective
In this project, I reproduced a basic File Integrity Monitor (FIM) using PowerShell ISE, emulating the core 
functionality typically used in enterprise environments to monitor and ensure the integrity of critical files. The 
script employs hash-based techniques to detect unauthorized changes, deletions, or modifications of files. By 
recreating this script, I aimed to develop my understanding of FIM and its importance in security monitoring.

### Skills Learned
- Core understanding of file integrity monitoring (FIM)
- Implemented hashing algorithms in PowerShell
- Improved knowledge of cybersecurity best practices in detecting potential threats through file integrity checks
- Gained insight into security auditing techniques

### Tools Used
- Windows PowerShell ISE
